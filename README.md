Lead Conversion Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a predictive model to enhance lead conversion rates using logistic regression. The model leverages historical lead data to predict the likelihood of conversion, providing valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

 Project Overview:
- Objective: Predict lead conversion probability to improve marketing effectiveness and allocate resources more efficiently.
- Data: The dataset includes various features such as lead origin, source, interaction history, and demographic information.
- Modeling: Applied Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Binomial family for logistic regression to predict conversion probabilities.
- Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, precision, recall, and F1-score. Optimization was performed by adjusting the cutoff threshold.

 Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Building: Logistic regression with feature selection and evaluation.
- Threshold Optimization: ROC curve analysis and precision-recall tradeoff.
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score.

 Usage:
1. Data Preparation: Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. Model Training: Fit the logistic regression model using the training set and evaluate performance.
3. Model Evaluation: Predict probabilities, analyze metrics, and optimize the cutoff threshold for better results.
4. Deployment: Integrate the model into marketing workflows to predict and improve lead conversion.
